Car Rental System - Capstone Project Description
This Car Rental System is a complete C programming project designed for managing vehicle rentals, including cars, buses, and bikes. It provides an easy-to-use console interface with two main user roles: Admin and Customer. The system helps automate bookings, track earnings, and manage vehicle availability efficiently.

Key Features
1. User Management
Registration & Login: Users can sign up as either customers or admins. Passwords are hidden for security.

Role-Based Access:

Admin can:

Add or remove vehicles (cars, buses, bikes).

Set discounts for customers.

View all bookings and earnings reports.

Customer can:

Book rides by selecting vehicles, routes, and seats.

View and cancel their bookings.

2. Vehicle & Route Management
Multiple Vehicle Types: Cars, buses, and bikes with different pricing.

Predefined Routes: Fixed routes with distance-based fares (e.g., Dhaka to Chittagong).

Seat Selection (For Buses): Customers can choose specific seats (like A1, B2) with real-time availability checks.

3. Booking System
Easy Booking Process: Customers pick a vehicle, route, date, and time to book.

Discount Application: Admins can set special discounts (e.g., 10% off).

Ticket Generation: Each booking gets a unique ID with details (fare, seat, date).

Cancellation: Customers can cancel bookings, freeing up seats.

4. Admin Dashboard
Revenue Tracking: Shows total earnings from all rentals.

Daily Reports: Checks how much money was made today.

Vehicle Management: Add, remove, or update vehicles.

5. Technical Details
File Storage: All data (users, bookings, vehicles) is saved in files.

Simple & Efficient: Uses basic C programming (structures, file handling, loops).

Works Everywhere: Runs on Windows and Linux.

Why This Project?
✅ Great for Learning: Helps practice C programming, file handling, and menu systems.
✅ Real-World Use: Useful for small rental businesses or transport services.
✅ Easy to Modify: New features (like payment systems) can be added.

This project is perfect for students or beginners who want to build a functional C program with real-world applications.
